## Welcome to the shapefile project!
I know this project is named **the shapefile project** but it actually does not contain nany shape file! I use geoJSON and gpkg (geopackage) formats to store these shapy stuff. I just feels shape files has a human touch to it, thta's it.

I plan to put all the stuff I hand drew using various sources here. I did not bother to list the sources as of now, will probably do it in the future.

The format I'm going for is two use two formats (geoJSON for small files and split files and gpkg for large files). geoJSON is a plain text format that can even be openend with a text editor and guthub has good support to even track the changes, however it can get quite large with more polygon and stuff very quickly and could slow down your GIS tool if dataset is large. But I still love the simplicity and the ease of viewing. That's why I'm planning to take advantage of both the format as each has it's own advantage.
